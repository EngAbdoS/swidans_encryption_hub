<h2>Encryption Algorithms</h2>
<h3>DES</h3>
<p>The Data Encryption Standard (DES) is a symmetric-key block cipher that uses a 56-bit key. It operates on 64-bit blocks of data and is widely used for encryption of electronic data. Swidan's Encryption Hub provides DES encryption and decryption functionalities with full and custom validation for inputs.</p>
<h3>Monoalphabetic</h3>
<p>Monoalphabetic substitution is a simple substitution cipher where each letter of the plaintext is replaced by another letter. Swidan's Encryption Hub provides Monoalphabetic encryption and decryption functionalities with full and custom validation for inputs.</p>
<h3>Caesar</h3>
<p>The Caesar cipher is a substitution cipher that shifts the letters of the plaintext by a certain number of positions. Swidan's Encryption Hub provides Caesar encryption and decryption functionalities with full and custom validation for inputs.</p>
<h3>Playfair</h3>
<p>The Playfair cipher is a polygraphic substitution cipher that encrypts pairs of letters instead of individual letters. Swidan's Encryption Hub provides Playfair encryption and decryption functionalities with full and custom validation for inputs.</p>
<h3>Polyalphabetic</h3>
<p>Polyalphabetic substitution is a cipher that uses multiple substitution alphabets. Swidan's Encryption Hub provides Polyalphabetic encryption and decryption functionalities with full and custom validation for inputs.</p>
<h3>Autokey</h3>
<p>The Autokey cipher is a polyalphabetic substitution cipher that uses the plaintext itself as the key for encryption. Swidan's Encryption Hub provides Autokey encryption and decryption functionalities with full and custom validation for inputs.</p>
<h3>Realfence</h3>
<p>The Realfence cipher is a transposition cipher that rearranges the characters of the plaintext according to a numeric key. Swidan's Encryption Hub provides Realfence encryption and decryption functionalities with full and custom validation for inputs.</p>

<h2>Authentication System</h2>
<p>Swidan's Encryption Hub provides a full authentication system that includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Login: users can log in to their account using their email and password.                   </li>
<li>Register: new users can create an account by providing their name, email, and password.</li>
<li>Reset password: users can reset their password by providing their email.</li>
<li>Email verification: new users need to verify their email address before they can log in.</li>
</ul>
<h2>User Profile</h2>
<p>Swidan's Encryption Hub provides a user profile system that allows users to view and edit their profile information.</p>
<h2>Encryption History
</h2>
<p>Swidan's Encryption Hub provides an encryption history system that allows users to view their previous encryption and decryption activities.</p>
<h2>Change Language</h2>
<p>Swidan's Encryption Hub provides a feature to change the language of the app to Arabic or English</p>
<h2>Developer Data
</h2>
<p>Swidan's Encryption Hub provides information about the developer, including their name, email, and GitHub profile.</p>
